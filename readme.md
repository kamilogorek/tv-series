## My TV Shows List
This is the list of all the TV series I've been watching since forever. I probably forget about some of them, so I'll update this list in near future. In the meantime - help me find some new interesting titles! If you want to propose something, just fork this repo and send pull request with the list updated in [TV Shows to consider](https://github.com/kamilogorek/tv-series/blob/master/data/proposals.js) part. Thanks in advance!

## TODO:

[ ] Move "The" prexies to the end of the title
[ ] Add notes column
